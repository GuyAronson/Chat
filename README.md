**TODO:**
* Consider shrink all data in the page- chat is too big
* test uploading profile picture from register page and the affects on the page
* Clicking on chat- means clicking on li, which is not always visible and clickable - consider change it or fix it
* Add sending message function - add to the DB, add to the screen, make sure the chat always shows the last message
* Add uploading files functions
